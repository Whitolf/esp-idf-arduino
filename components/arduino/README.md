# Fork Notes

This is a fork of https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/idf-release/v4.2 that actually builds successfully when added as a component to a boilerplate project targeting https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/release/v4.2 .

## Background

`arduino-esp32` can be added as a component to your `esp-idf`-based project. These two libraries are tightly coupled and will not compile unless both are on the same release. However, upstream has several other issues preventing a success build, even in a blank project. This fork fixes this, at the cost of removing `LITTLEFS` and `NetBIOS` libraries.

## Usage

See [Using as ESP-IDF component](docs/esp-idf_component.md) (also updated).

### Decoding exceptions

You can use [EspExceptionDecoder](https://github.com/me-no-dev/EspExceptionDecoder) to get meaningful call trace.

### Issue/Bug report template
Before reporting an issue, make sure you've searched for similar one that was already created. Also make sure to go through all the issues labelled as [for reference](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22for%20reference%22%20).

Finally, if you are sure no one else had the issue, follow the [ISSUE_TEMPLATE](docs/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) while reporting any issue.

### Tip

Sometimes to program ESP32 via serial you must keep GPIO0 LOW during the programming process
